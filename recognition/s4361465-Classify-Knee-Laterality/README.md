s4361465 Kelsey McGahan 

Binary CNN classification of left and right sidedness of images of knees.

- [ ] Description of algorithms

- [ ] Problem that algorithm slves

- [ ] how it works ( in a paragraph and a figure/visualisation)

- [ ] list any dependencies (does this include libraries??)

- [ ] provide example outputs and plots of algorithm code

- [ ] describe and justify your training, validation adn testing split of the data


Dependencies:
* Tensorflow 
* Python
