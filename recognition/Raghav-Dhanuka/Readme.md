Data Analysis - Pattern Recognition -  Segment the ISICs data set with the UNet [2] with all labels having a minimum Dice similarity coefficient
of 0.7 on the test set.

Extracting the Dataset and Preprocessing steps are completed - normalization and One-hotencoding and test train valid split
Created the dice coeff and dice loss function.
Unet Architecture defined.
Model val_accuracy is 0.89 which is satisfactory.
