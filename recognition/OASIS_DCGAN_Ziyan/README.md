# DCGAN On OASIS - Ziyan Wang
This project is an assignment of [COMP3710](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=comp3710) from 
The University of Queensland. The whole readme will contains 5 parts, the first part will mainly introduce the algorithm
(DCGAN) used in the project.

## Algorithm

### GAN
Before the introduction of DCGAN, I'd like to introduce GAN firstly. The GAN is made up of two parts of models, 
generator and discriminator. In the case given in the course, GAN is used for picture generating. The generator model
is responsible for generator a fake image, and discriminator is responsible for the determination of fake output and
real output.

## Problems


## Contributing
* Fork the dedicated 'topic-recognition' branch
* Create a directory for your problem and place your code into it.
* Your code should have functions in a separate module and a driver (main) script that runs it with parameters defined.
* The driver script should preferably either plot or save an image of the generated results
* Add a README.md file that describes the problem, its solution and shows a picture of it.
* You may upload a low res image (< 2 MB) into a folder called 'resources' in your problem directory for displaying on the README.md file
* You can see an example of this in the [SMILI repository](./src/main_64.ipynb).
* Then put in a pull request for the repository owner to approve and that's it!
