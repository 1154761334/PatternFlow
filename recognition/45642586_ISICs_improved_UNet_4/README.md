Title: Image Segmentation (Improved UNet on ISICs data set) by Xiao Sun

Student name: Xiao Sun;

For COMP3710 Pattern Recognition Report, I choose the fourth problem, which is: 
4. Segment the ISICs data set with the Improved UNet [1] with all labels having a minimum Dice similarity coefficient of 0.8 on the test set. [Normal Difficulty]

Description of algorithm and the problem solved:


Usage of the module (how it works):
Please run the driver script (driver.py) to call the Improved UNet module in UNet_model.py. The UNet_model is imported by driver.py 
and training/test on ISICs 2018 data set to finish the image sementation, where the Improved UNet module is implemented based on Tensorflow.
In the driver script, we import ISICs 2018 data set and also import the Improved UNet module from UNet_model.py. If we would like to 
apply the Improved UNet module on other dataset, the UNet_model.py can be imported and we can modify the parameters and hyperparameters.
