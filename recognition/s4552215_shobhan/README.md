The Objective:

To Segment the ISICs data set with the UNet with all labels having a minimum Dice similarity coefficient of 0.7 on the test set.

Data Set:
Input – The input data set are dermascopic lesion images in JPEG format. 
Response Data –The Mask images are PNGs of grayscale, where each pixel is either 0(Background of image) or 255(foreground of image).

Train, Validation and Test Split:
The overall sample size is 2594 and the train, validation and test split ratio is 60:20:20. 

UNET Architecture:
