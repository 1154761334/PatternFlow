# Histogram using tensorflow
Basically this function will help to plot a histogram for a grey image. If the image is colored and has multiple channels, the user should separate the image into different channels and then perform the function. 
Suppose the shape of one grey image is (500, 500), the value for each pixel varies from 0 to 255, which means each pixel has 256 possibilities. The histogram function will return the distribution of each value, telling the user how the color varies in a directed way.

## An example of its use
The original image: built-in image Camera
