# Number Theory
Containing implementation of the Euclidean Algorithm as well as the extended version.

Both algorithms require a two integer input and depending on the chosen algorithm will compute the greatest common divisor a long with the quotients needed to satisfy the equation ax + by = gcd(a,b)
